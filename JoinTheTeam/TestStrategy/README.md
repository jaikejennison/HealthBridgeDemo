## 1. Introduction

This document provides the Testing Strategy for the Join The Team Page. It includes the following components:

* Testing Strategy Overview
* Background
* Scope

### 1.1. Audience

The audience for this document includes system development team members, HealthBridge Financial project team members, and members of the QA team.

## 2. Testing Strategy Overview

The Join The Team Page Testing Strategy determines the projectâ€™s approach to testing. The strategy looks at the characteristics of the tests to be conducted, the project time line and budget, and plans the breadth and depth of the testing effort. The Testing Strategy will influence tasks related to test planning, test types, test script development, and test execution.

### 2.1. Objectives

The key objectives are as follows:

* Determine the significance, or critical nature, of the Join The Team Page to the business.
* Determine the types of tests required by each testing task.
* Determine the need for manual testing by identifying key page elements.
* Determine the need for Automated testing by identifying key page elements.
* Identify performance assurance requirements.

### 2.2. Deliverable Audience

The Join The Team Page Testing Strategy is intended for the following audience:

* QA and HealthBridge analysts and designers
* QA and HealthBridge testers
* Dev Ops
* Other team members that may be involved in the systems integration test

### 2.3. Benefits

The Testing Strategy can provide the following benefits:

* Faster development of testing requirements by directly using key project deliverables
* Earlier identification of testing requirements
* Independence of testing from development tasks and resources
* Well-defined tests
* Progressive and additive testing tasks

## 3. Background

There are two main elements to the Join The Team Page. The first is a search and filtering element. The second is a results list which can dynamically change depending on the requirement of search and filtering element.

The key search and filtering elements are as follows:

* Text input field
* Category pull-down menu
* Job Type pull-down menu
* Location pull-down menu
* Submit button

The key results list elements are as follows:

* Title
* Category
* Location
* General creation date
* Read More button

All of the search and filtering elements must be tested individually and in concert with one another to insure that all elements behave as expected, both on their own and in combination with other elements. The corresponding result list must return results that fit each of the search and filtering parameters. The read more button must be clickable and link to a new page that contains the correct information from the list element.

## 4. Scope

To define the testing scope of Join The Team Page, the following areas were examined:

* Test types by task
* Testing environments
* Testing tools

### 4.1. Test Types by Task

The following list identifies, by testing task, the types of testing that will be conducted:
